The main code is SPINS_DTIQAv3.m which I have called DTIQA_Handout_Joe.m (for my book keeping purposes).

I included the processSPINS.m and renameDCM_standardExSeIm.m just so that you can
follow how I call SPINS_DTIQAv3.m. Also, I included the load*m files for each site but
I just tried it all on a nifti (created by dcm2nii) and then load that nifti into matlab
(however you do that) and get 4D matrix: N x N x numslices x numvols (numvols=total # vols=numgraddirs+numb0)

The DWI used by most of the code is an average of the 3 central slices so the 3d dimension is dropped
and there are only 3-dimensions: N x N x numvols. If you have that, you can enter the main code
at MAIN PART.

None of the steps should be site specific once you have the 3D DWI matrix.
