In order to use the tests in this directory that import code from outside of datman/datman
(e.g. modules in datman/bin) the following must be true:

	1. __init__.py must be present in the directory with the modules being imported
	2. nosetests must be run from the datman folder OR the path to datman must be in 
	   PYTHONPATH

Otherwise these tests will cause an ImportError to be thrown.
