### Some definitions

 - Exam/Scan: A series of MRI acquisitions completed in one sitting. 
 - Series/Acquisition: A single image of a subject in one modality
 - Exam archive: The raw data taken during an exam. For MRI, this could be a
   folder structure of DICOM images, or a tarball/zipfile of that same data, 
 - Type tag: A short, keyword that distinguishes a kind of acquisition from
   other kinds in a study. For instance, T1, DTI, REST. These type tags are
